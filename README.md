# Design Pattern in Python
In the python community there is a lot of confliction on wether or not to use Design Patterns. Some people belive certain Design Patterns to be `unpythonic`. Others belive that they have `useful use cases`.

I have used Design Patterns in other languages and find them quite useful. Thus I will be exploring design patterns in python3 to see if it is worth implementing.

### Steps:
1. Create some design patterns with implementions of them.
2. See how the problem would be done without design patterns.
3. Describe findings.

### Notes:
#### Looking to engage with fellow peers on my implementations and improving them.

I take greate interest in the speed of a the program, so if you know anything on improving the speed, feed back would be much appreciated.
