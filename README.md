# Design Pattern in Python
In the python community there is a lot of confliction on using Design Patterns.
I have used Design Patterns in other languages and find them quite useful.

### Reason for doing this?
Some people belive certain Design Patterns to be `unpythonic`. Others belive that they have `useful use cases`.
I want to make up my mind on whether design patterns is worth implementing in Python3.

### Steps I will be taking:
1. Create some design patterns with implementions of them.
2. See how the problem would be done without design patterns.
3. Describe findings.
